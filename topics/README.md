# This is the `topics` folder in the standard SDLE git repository structure

The `topics` folder is an interface between groups sharing the repository, and is meant to contain final reports (in RMD format) and/or presentations (in Rpres format). 

Each file should follow a naming structure, describing the attributes of the file.

For example: 1604-CWRU-RapidAlloy-topics, where
        - 1604: year and month,
        - CWRU: team working on the file
        - RapidAlloy: title of the project
        - topics: specific topic discussed in the file

If there is a recursive reporting schedule, then adding bookmarks might help in arranging and compilation of multiple files.

One way to change the index TOC is 
        - \setcounter{section}{11}; where 11 sets the counter to 11.
