    - Is undergraduate class for "general" applied data science
  - DSCI35xM (x=1,2,3) focuses on materials science systems
  - DSCI45x (x=1,2,3)
    - Is a graduate level class
    - With the same class material and DSCI35x
    - Additionally the students do a 40 point Semester Data Analysis Project

##### DSCI45x Graduate level courses

  - For graduate students, 
    - DSCI451 is not a required prerequisite
  - Therefore some DSCI453 grad. students
    - Do not have familiarity with Open Data Science, R, Git etc.
  - For these "New to R" students
    - The initial 3 weeks in class have optional content
    - To get people familiar with Open Data Science
    

##### Semester Data Science Projects

  - Are done in DSCI352, 352M by students who have completed both DSCI351,3
  - And by graduate students in DSCI 451, 453 and 452
  
For DSCI45x students, their Semester Project is developed in DSCI352 class

  - With Prof. Laura Bruckman
  - During team meetings during Friday Community Hour
    - 12:45 to 1:45 in Olin 303
  - And during class office hours
    - Monday/Wednesday 4pm to 5pm in White 540
  - There are weekly SemProj updates due each week on progress
  - And 3 SemProj Presentations in DSCI35x class

#### Syllabus

![Modeling, Prediction and Machine Learning Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png) 

#### Operating Systems: Windows, OSX and Linux

Command Line Environments

  - Linux: Bash on Linux, or Git Bash on Windows
  - Mac OSX: Bash in Terminal
  - Windows: Command.com Terminal
  - In R: R Console, or Console in RStudio
  


    Item               Linux       OSX Mac       Windows 
-----------------  ------------  ------------  ------------ 
folder demarcation     /              /        "\\" don't use
directory listing     ls             ls            dir     
present work. dir     pwd           pwd           
change directory      cd            cd               cd
drives               root          root         drive letters
NO SPACES in        filenames     spaces         don't work


##### Basic/Universal Rules

  - No Spaces in Filenames
  - Only 1 period in a filename, before file extension
  - No other periods
  - Only Letters, Underscore (_), and Dashes (-) in Filenames
  - In code scripts, use forward slash in all file paths and directorys
  - You can use CamelBack or snake_case in variable or file names
    - To make code easier to read.
  - Code Style is Rstudio or Google R style
  - No use of = for Assignments
  - Only use <- as the Assignment Operator in R
    - Rstudio Cheat Sheet says <- is "Alt -" in R code



#### Quick Introduction to R/Rstudio/Git

R is the statistical programming language

Rstudio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Git is the distributed content versioning system

#### Intro to some R: Data Types
 
  * Primitives (numeric, integer, character, logical, factor)
  * Data Frames
  * Lists
  * Tables
  * Arrays
  * Environments
  * Others (functions, closures, promises..)
 
##### Simple Types 

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
x <- 1
class(x)
 
y <- "Hello World"
class(y)
 
z <- TRUE
class(z)
 
as.integer(z)
```

##### Example: Generating Random Data {.smaller}

```{r}
randomWalk <- function(N)(cumsum(ifelse(rbinom(prob = 0.5, size = 1, N) == 0,-1,1)))
AUDUSD <- 1.2345 + randomWalk(1000)*.0001
plot(AUDUSD, type = 'l')
```
