# ====================================================
# ISLR 2.3.1 Basic Commands

# To run a function called funcname,we type funcname(input1, input2), 
  # where the inputs (or arguments) input1 and input2 tell R how to run the function. 

# c()
  # For example, to create a vector of numbers, we use the function c() (for concatenate). 
    # Any numbers inside the parentheses are joined together. 
    # The following command instructs R to join together the numbers 1, 3, 2, and 5, 
    # and to save them as a vector named x. 
    # When we type x, it gives us back the vector.

x <- c(1,3,2,5)
x

# will call up help for the funcname

# Note that the > is not part of the command; 
  # rather, it is printed by R to indicate that it is ready for another command to be entered. 

# Don't use =, use <-, subtle hazards arise if you use =

x <- c(1,6,2)
x
y <- c(1,4,3)

# Hitting the up arrow multiple times will display the previous commands, which can then be edited. 
  # This is useful since one often wishes to repeat a similar command. 

#In addition, typing ?funcname will always cause R to open a new help file window 
  # with additional information about the function

# length()
  # We can tell R to add two sets of numbers together. 
    # It will then add the first number from x to the first number from y, and so on. 
    # However, x and y should be the same length. 
    # We can check their length using the length() function.

length(x)
length(y)
x + y

# ls() and rm()
  # The ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects, 
    # such as data and functions, that we have saved so far. 
  # The rm() function can be used to delete any that we don’t want.

ls()
rm(x,y)
ls()

# It’s also possible to remove all objects at once:

# rm(list <- ls())

# matrix()
  # The matrix() function can be used to create a matrix of numbers. 
    # Before we use the matrix() function, we can learn more about it:

?matrix

# The help file reveals that the matrix() function takes a number of inputs,
  # but for now we focus on the first three: 
    # the data (the entries in the matrix),
    # the number of rows, and 
    # the number of columns. 

# First, we create a simple matrix.

x <- matrix(data <- c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
x

# Note that we could just as well omit typing data=, nrow=, and ncol= in the matrix() command above: 
  # that is, we could just type

x <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2)

# and this would have the same effect. 

# However, it can sometimes be useful to specify the names of the arguments passed in, 
  # since otherwise R will assume that the function arguments are passed into the function 
  # in the same order that is given in the function’s help file. 
# As this example illustrates, by default R creates matrices by successively filling in columns. 
  # Alternatively, the byrow=TRUE option can be used to populate the matrix in order of the rows.

matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2,byrow = TRUE)

# Notice that in the above command we did not assign the matrix to a value such as x. 
  # In this case the matrix is printed to the screen 
  # but is not saved for future calculations. 

# sqrt()
  # The sqrt() function returns the square root of each element of a vector or matrix

sqrt(x)

# x^2
# The command x^2 raises each element of x to the power 2; 
  # any powers are possible, including fractional or negative powers.

x^2

# rnorm()
  # The rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables,
    # with first argument n the sample size. 
  # Each time we call this function, we will get a different answer. 
# cor()
  # Here we create two correlated sets of numbers, x and y, and 
  # use the cor() function 
    # to compute the correlation between them.

x <- rnorm(50)
y <- x + rnorm(50,mean = 50,sd = .1)
cor(x,y)

# By default, rnorm() creates standard normal random variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
  # However, the mean and standard deviation can be altered using the mean and sd arguments, as illustrated above.

# Sometimes we want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers; 
  # we can use the set.seed() function to do this. 
  # The set.seed() function takes an (arbitrary) integer argument.

set.seed(1303)
rnorm(50)

# We use set.seed() throughout the labs whenever we perform calculations involving random quantities. 
  # In general this should allow the user to reproduce our results. 
  # However, it should be noted that as new versions of R become available 
    # it is possible that some small discrepancies may form between the book and the output from R.

# mean(), var(), sd()
  # The mean() and var() functions can be used to 
    # compute the mean and variance of a vector of numbers. 
  # Applying sqrt() to the output of var()will give the standard deviation. 
    # Or we can simply use the sd() function.

set.seed(3)
y <- rnorm(100)
mean(y)
var(y)
sqrt(var(y))
sd(y)

# ISLR 2.3.2 Graphics

# plot()
  # The plot() function is the primary way to plot data in R. 
    # For instance, plot(x,y) produces a scatterplot of the numbers in x versus the numbers in y. 
  # There are many additional options that can be passed in to the plot() function. 
    # For example, passing in the argument xlab will result in a label on the x-axis. 
  # To find out more information about the plot() function, type ?plot.

x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
plot(x,y,xlab = "this is the x-axis",ylab = "this is the y-axis",main = "Plot of X vs Y")

# pdf(), jpeg()
  # We will often want to save the output of an R plot. 
    # The command that we use to do this will depend on the file type that we would like to create. 
  # For instance, to create a pdf, we use the pdf() function, 
    # and to create a jpeg, we use the jpeg() function.

pdf("Figure.pdf")
plot(x,y,col = "green")
dev.off()

getwd()

# setwd("./1-class/figs")
getwd()

# The function dev.off() indicates to R that we are done creating the plot.
  # Alternatively, we can simply copy the plot window 
    # and paste it into an appropriate file type, such as a Word document.
  # But this is not a useful practice to use
    # Better to caputure your figure as an individual file in your repo.

# seq()
  # The function seq() can be used to create a sequence of numbers. 
    # For instance, seq(a,b) makes a vector of integers between a and b. 
   # There are many other options: 
    # for instance, seq(0,1,length=10) makes a sequence of10 numbers that are equally spaced between 0 and 1. 
    # Typing 3:11 is a shorthand for seq(3,11) for integer arguments.

x <- seq(1,10)
x
x <- 1:10
x
x <- seq(-pi,pi,length = 50)

# contour()
  # We will now create some more sophisticated plots. 
  # The contour() function produces a contour plot 
    # in order to represent three-dimensional data;
    # it is like a topographical map. 
  # It takes three arguments:
    # 1. A vector of the x values (the first dimension),
    # 2. A vector of the y values (the second dimension), and
    # 3. A matrix whose elements correspond to the z value (the third dimension) for each pair of (x,y) coordinates.
  # As with the plot() function, 
    # there are many other inputs that can be used to fine-tune the output of the contour() function. 
    # To learn more about these, take a look at the help file by typing ?contour.

y <- x
f <- outer(x,y,function(x,y)cos(y)/(1 + x^2))
contour(x,y,f)
contour(x,y,f,nlevels = 45,add = T)
fa <- (f - t(f))/2
contour(x,y,fa,nlevels = 15)

# image(), heatmap(), persp()
  # The image() function works the same way as contour(), 
    # except that it produces a color-coded plot whose colors depend on the z value. 
  # This is known as a heatmap, 
    # and is sometimes used to plot temperature in weatherforecasts. 
  # Alternatively, persp() can be used to produce a three-dimensional plot. 
    # The arguments theta and phi control 
      # the angles at which the plot is viewed.

image(x,y,fa)
persp(x,y,fa)
persp(x,y,fa,theta = 30)
persp(x,y,fa,theta = 30,phi = 20)
persp(x,y,fa,theta = 30,phi = 70)
persp(x,y,fa,theta = 30,phi = 40)

# ISLR 2.3.3 Indexing Data


# We often wish to examine part of a set of data. 
  # Suppose that our data is stored in the matrix A.

A <- matrix(1:16,4,4)
A

# Then typing

A[2,3]

# will select the element corresponding to the second row and the third column. 
  # The first number after the open-bracket symbol [ 
    # always refers to the row, 
  # and the second number 
    # always refers to the column. 
  # We can also select multiple rows and columns at a time, 
    # by providing vectors as the indices.

A[c(1,3),c(2,4)]
A[1:3,2:4]
A[1:2,]
A[,1:2]


# The last two examples include either 
  # no index for the columns or 
  # no index for the rows. 
# These indicate that R should include all columns 
  # or all rows, respectively. 
# R treats a single row or column of a matrix as a vector.

A[1,]

# The use of a negative sign - in the index 
  # tells R to keep all rows or columns except those indicated in the index.

A[-c(1,3),]
A[-c(1,3),-c(1,3,4)]

# dim()
  # The dim() function outputs the number of rows 
    # followed by the number of columns of a given matrix.

dim(A)

# ISLR 2.3.4 Loading Data

# read.table(), write.table()
  # For most analyses, the first step involves importing a data set into R . 
  # The read.table() function 
    # is one of the primary ways to do this. 
    # The help file contains details about how to use this function. 
  # We can use the function write.table() 
    #to export data.

Auto <- read.table("./2-class/data/Auto.data")
fix(Auto)

# Note that Auto.data is simply a text file, 
  # which you could alternatively open on your computer using a standard text editor. 
# It is often a good idea to view a data set 
  # using a text editor or other software such as Excel 
  # before loading it into R.

# This particular data set has not been loaded correctly, 
  # because R has assumed that the variable names are part of the data and 
  # so has included them in the first row. 
# The data set also includes a number of missing observations, indicated by a question mark ?. 
#Missing values are a common occurrence in real data sets. 
# Using the option header=T (or header=TRUE) in the read.table() function 
  # tells R that the first line of the file 
    # contains the variable names, and 
# using the option na.strings tells R that any time it sees a particular character 
  # or set of characters (such as a question mark),
  # it should be treated as a missing element of the data matrix.

Auto <- read.table("./2-class/data/Auto.data",header = T,na.strings = "?")
fix(Auto)

# Excel is a common-format data storage program. 
  # An easy way to load such data into R 
  # is to save it as a csv (comma separated value) file and 
    # then use the read.csv() function to load it in.

Auto <- read.csv("./2-class/data/Auto.csv",header = T,na.strings = "?")
fix(Auto)
dim(Auto)
Auto[1:4,]

# dim(), na.omit()
  # The dim() function tells us that the data has 397 observations, or rows,
    # and nine variables, or columns. 
  # There are various ways to deal with the missing data. 
  # In this case, only five of the rows contain missing observations, 
    # and so we choose to use the na.omit() function to simply remove these rows.

Auto <- na.omit(Auto)
dim(Auto)

# names()
  # Once the data are loaded correctly, we can use names() 
    # to check the variable names.

names(Auto)

# =========================================================
# Additional Graphical and Numerical Summaries


# scatterplot()
  # We can use the plot() function 
    # to produce scatterplots of the quantitative variables. 
  # However, simply typing the variable names will produce an error message, 
    # because R does not know to look in the Auto data set for those variables.

#plot(cylinders, mpg)


# attach()
  # To refer to a variable, 
    # we must type the data set and the variable name joined with a $ symbol. 
  # Alternatively, we can use the attach() function 
    # in order to tell R to make the variables in this data frame available by name.

plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg)
attach(Auto)
plot(cylinders, mpg)


# as.factor
  # The cylinders variable is stored as a numeric vector, 
    # so R has treated it as quantitative. 
  # However, since there are only a small number of possible values for cylinders, 
    # one may prefer to treat it as a qualitative (categorical) variable.
  # The as.factor() function 
    # converts quantitative variables into qualitative variables.

cylinders <- as.factor(cylinders)

# boxplot()
  # If the variable plotted on the x-axis is categorial, 
    # then boxplots will automatically be produced by the plot() function. 
  # As usual, a number of options can be specified in order to customize the plots.

plot(cylinders, mpg)
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red")
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T)
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T,horizontal = T)
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T, xlab = "cylinders", ylab = "MPG")


# hist()
  # The hist() function can be used to plot a histogram. 
    # Note that col=2 has the same effect as col="red".

hist(mpg)
hist(mpg,col = 2)
hist(mpg,col = 2,breaks = 15)

# pairs(), the scatterplot matrix or pair-wise plot
  # The pairs() function creates a scatterplot matrix 
    # i.e. a scatterplot for every pair of variables 
      # for any given data set. 
  # We can also produce scatterplots for just a subset of the variables.
pairs(Auto)
pairs(~ mpg + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration, Auto)

# identify()
  # In conjunction with the plot() function, 
    # identify() provides a useful interactive method 
    # for identifying the value for a particular variable for points on a plot. 
  # We pass in three arguments to identify(): 
    # the x-axis variable, 
    # the y-axis variable, and 
    # the variable whose values we would like to see printed for each point. 
  # Then clicking on a given point in the plot 
    # will cause R to print the value of the variable of interest. 
    # Right-clicking on the plot will exit the identify() function (control-click on a Mac). 
    # The numbers printed under the identify() function 
      # correspond to the rows for the selected points.

plot(horsepower,mpg)
identify(horsepower,mpg,name)

# summary()
  # The summary() function produces a numerical summary 
    # of each variable in a particular data set.

summary(Auto)

# For qualitative variables such as name, 
  # R will list the number of observations that fall in each category. 
  # We can also produce a summary of just a single variable.

summary(mpg)

# q(), savehistory, loadhistory
# Once we have finished using R, 
  # we type q() in order to shut it down, or quit. 
# When exiting R, we have the option to save the current workspace 
  # so that all objects (such as data sets) that we have created in this R sessionwill be available next time. 
  # Before exiting R, we may want to save a record of all of the commands that we typed in the most recent session; 
  # this can be accomplished using the savehistory() function.
# Next time we enter R, 
  # we can load that history using the loadhistory() function.
