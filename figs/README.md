# This is the `figs` folder of the standard SDLE git repository structure.

The `figs` folder is meant to contain various images for use in markdowns or presentations that originate from external sources, and are not the generated output of written code. 

Plots made by code are meant to be created internally within their Rmd or Rpres files, rather than saved here as images.
In this way changes and updates to generated plots are saved as plaintext, rather than tracking multiple versions in git.

Please keep in mind, smaller files sizes are better, and will make downloads of the repository go more smoothly.
