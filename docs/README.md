# This is the `docs` folder in the standard SDLE git repository structure.

The `docs` folder is meant to contain internal documentation (in the form of Rmd or Rpres files) describing technical details of how things in the repository work.

This could be documentation detailing how code in a code repository is meant to be used, or how a lab procedure was conducted for a report in a project repo, for example.

Ideally, code documentation is incorporated into the formalized structure of a portable code package developed in a code repository, but can be developed here first.
