The data used for MMR Modeling is in: V:\vuv-data\proj\3M\WRC\PIT in sub folders for color, gloss, and haze.

The metadata key files are located in: V:\vuv-data\proj\3M\WRC
    samples: mmmSampleKey.csv
    indoor exposure: mmmIndoorKey.csv
    outdoor exposure: mmmOutdoorKey.csv
    outdoor sample mouting: mmmOutdoorMount.csv

The MMR modeling script is in the 18-matls repo: 
    .\18-matls\scripts\dgr-1706-MMRSplinesModeling. 
    This script also contains a good bit of data pre-processing, data cleaning, variable selection, prediction, and plotting as well. 
    Once the data frame was set up, the variable selection and MMR modeling fitting was quite straightforward: 

# Forward Selection - White PET
    null <- lm(cbind(dE,dGloss60)~1,data = outdoor.white)
    full <- lm(cbind(dE,dGloss60)~bs(UVA.340)+Tracking+Humidity+OnGlass+UnderGlass+M238+M243+MMM6+UL+U2, data = outdoor.white)
    mStep(null, trace = TRUE,scope=list(upper=full), k=2, direction="forward", data=outdoor.white)

# Natural Spline Version
    vper <- c(91,94)
    knot_Q <- quantile(outdoor.white$UVA.340,vper/100)

    model.outdoor.white <- lm(cbind(dE, dGloss60) ~ M238 + MMM6 + UL + U2 + M243 + Humidity + 
                            ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q) + ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q):M243 +
                           ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q):M238 + ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q):U2 + ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q):UL +
                           ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q):MMM6 + ns(UVA.340,knot=knot_Q):Humidity , data=outdoor.white)
    summary(model.outdoor.white)
