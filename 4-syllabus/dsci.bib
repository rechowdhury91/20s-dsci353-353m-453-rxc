	title = {Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models},
	abstract = {An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. In order to allocate a given budget optimally, for example, an advertiser must assess to what extent different campaigns have contributed to an incremental lift in web searches, product installs, or sales. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates, i.e., synthetic controls. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for model inversion, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on synthetic data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by evaluating the effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The {CausalImpact} R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting\textemdash{}the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented.

	volume = {25},
	issn = {0885-8950},
	doi = {10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2036017},
	abstract = {Long-term electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in planning for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation. In a long-term context, planners must adopt a probabilistic view of potential peak demand levels. Therefore density forecasts (providing estimates of the full probability distributions of the possible future values of the demand) are more helpful than point forecasts, and are necessary for utilities to evaluate and hedge the financial risk accrued by demand variability and forecasting uncertainty. This paper proposes a new methodology to forecast the density of long-term peak electricity demand. Peak electricity demand in a given season is subject to a range of uncertainties, including underlying population growth, changing technology, economic conditions, prevailing weather conditions (and the timing of those conditions), as well as the general randomness inherent in individual usage. It is also subject to some known calendar effects due to the time of day, day of week, time of year, and public holidays. A comprehensive forecasting solution is described in this paper. First, semi-parametric additive models are used to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables, including temperatures, calendar effects and some demographic and economic variables. Then the demand distributions are forecasted by using a mixture of temperature simulation, assumed future economic scenarios, and residual bootstrapping. The temperature simulation is implemented through a new seasonal bootstrapping method with variable blocks. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the probability distribution of annual and weekly peak electricity demand for South Australia since 2007. The performance of the methodology is evaluated by comparing the forecast results with the actual demand of the summer 2007-2008.},

	abstract = {Continual improvement in the quality of products, processes, and services has been facilitated by applying statistical methods. The statistical process control technique ({SPC}) provides enhanced results, as it utilizes statistical methods throughout all the developmental stages of a project and/or production. One of these techniques is control charts, which are powerful tools for viewing and understanding different types of process variations. Therefore, it is essential for professionals linked to engineering and technological fields to be familiar with these techniques and software programs, in order to facilitate the development process for creating control charts. The majority of these software programs designed for easy utilization and friendly interface for {SPC} applications are sold at high prices and thereby make access impossible to this computational resource for freelance professionals, small businesses, and especially students. The {GNU} R interface is open source and provides free access as one of the alternatives. So, for this purpose, this paper presents the description and application of control charts in three different R interfaces, as its objective is to use them for the teaching and learning process.},

Lyrics:
Please be my covariate
It's just my way of saying it
You exceed my expectation
You're my greatest deviation
So please be my alternative
Reject the null for good
I want to maximize your likelihood

I love you categorically
And not just metaphorically
You're my one and only density
My power and intensity
Oh baby, you're the one
There could never be another
My statistically significant other

My love and my obsession
You're my linear regression
My favorite observation
My perfect estimation
And all my simulations show
That we have got potential
I'm your log and you're my exponential

You generate my moments and
There is no error here
I have to make you understand
I have to say it clear
You're my interval of confidece
I'm sure you know it too
There's really nothing normal about you.

No more pairwise independence
I'm gonna tell you why
No more 2 degrees of freedom
I wanna square your chi
I've made multiple comparisons
And so I know it's true
My sigma will be lost without your mu

Some people say I'm crazy
But that's Ok with me
You might be inconsistent
And I'm not bias free
But baby you're the one
You're the alpha to my beta
Don't you know it: you're my missing data!},

area of distributed systems and networks. Distributed computing now encompasses
many of the activities occurring in today’s computer and communications
world. Indeed, distributed computing appears in quite diverse application areas:
Typical “old school” examples are parallel computers, or the Internet. More recent
application examples of distributed systems include peer-to-peer systems,
sensor networks, and multi-core architectures.
These applications have in common that many processors or entities (often
called nodes) are active in the system at any moment. The nodes have certain
degrees of freedom: they may have their own hardware, their own code, and
sometimes their own independent task. Nevertheless, the nodes may share common
resources and information, and, in order to solve a problem that concerns
several—or maybe even all—nodes, coordination is necessary.},
