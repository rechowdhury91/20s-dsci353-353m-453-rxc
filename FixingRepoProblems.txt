You still have access to the prof repo, is that correct? 
         If not then Donghui needs to add your bitbucket username as have READ access to the Prof repo.

Here is what to do, If I understand your problem correctly.

When you have problems pushing or pulling your repo on your VDI to/from your repo up on bitbucket.

1.  Take your repo on VDI, located in H:\Git\"reponame"
1a. Make a folder H:\bkup\
2. Copy all that folder, its files and subfolders to a different place on H:, ie H:\bkup\ 
3. Now you have a safe backup of all your current working files.
4. Now delete the folder/subfolders and all files, in H:\Git\"reponame" so that it is gone.

5. Now go and clone your repo from Bitbucket, so you have a fresh local copy.
6. Now you should be able to git pull and git push without problem, to your VDI.
7. After successfully git pulling, move any single files that were in your old repo from H:\bkup\reponame, one at a time to your new H:\Git\reponame repository.
8 Then git add ., git commit and git push, and they will go up to Bitbucket.

9. If you have the problem that you can't sync from Prof repo on Bitbucket to your own repo on bitbucket, then you still do steps 1 to 4, so that you back up your local repository.
10 Now on bitbucket delete your own repository, so that it is gone.
11. Now re-fork my prof repo on bitbucket.
Then return to the list above and do steps 5 to 8.
